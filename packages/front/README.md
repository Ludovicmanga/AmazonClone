## Amazon Clone

This project's purpose is to get better with NestJs, and most importantly, with TDD, and Redis.

The features are simple. A user must be able to :

- Search a product by name
- Search a product by name and category
- View products of a specific category
- Create a product, and specify its main and sub categories

There must be unit tests, and all the backend tests must be done using TDD
Redis must be used, as much as posible
